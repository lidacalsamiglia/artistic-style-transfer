This is our final project of Deep Learning. Artistic Style Transfer (Neural Style Transfer) is a technique that takes an image and outputs that image with a determined artistic style. We follow the Neural-Style algorithm developed by Leon A. Gatys, Alexander S. Ecker and Matthias Bethge (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.06576.pdf).  

In this project we use a pretrained VGG model from pytorch and implement color preservation and masking to the generated images. We also do some modifications to achieve two style transfer. Throughout the provided ipynb notebook you can see the obtained results and the different outputs modifying parameters. If you want to run this notebook in your computer (and not Google Collab) be sure to have the necessary libraries installed.
